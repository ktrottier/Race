###Rabbit vs Turtle vs Human race

Who will win the race?

I know what I would like the code to execute but I just don't know how to make it functional.

Basically, the constructor should auto-calculate randomly either 0 or 1 and plug in the numbers in order to get an output figure for each object:
rabbit, turtle, human.

As long as the output figure is less than 100, then the calculation should continue and keep adding until one of the three objects reach 100.
